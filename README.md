# Virtual Book for Young Children

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project designed to provide an interactive, virtual book experience for young children. Users can flip through pages of different stories, with each page including text and images, creating an engaging and educational environment for young readers.

## Features

- Multiple stories for children to explore.
- Pages that can be flipped through, just like a physical book.
- Images included on each page to complement the story.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```
## Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

For iOS
```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

You can also run the app directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modifying your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make some modifications.

Open **App.tsx** in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.

For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS)) to see your changes.

For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
You've successfully run and modified your React Native Virtual Book App! ðŸ“–âœ¨
